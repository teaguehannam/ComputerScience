# Machine Learning for Text and Graph-Based Mining

### Theory, design, and implementation of text-based information systems. Includes statistical characteristics of text, representation of information needs and documents, several important retrieval models (Boolean, vector space, probabilistic, inference net, language modeling), clustering algorithms, automatic text categorization, and experimental evaluation. The software architecture components include design and implementation of high-capacity text retrieval and text filtering systems.
